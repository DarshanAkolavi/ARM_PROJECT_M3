## Remote Keyless Entry Systems

* The term remote keyless system (RKS), also called keyless entry or remote central locking, refers to a lock that uses an electronic remote control as a key which is activated by a handheld device or automatically by proximity.

* Keyless entry is a convenient system that removes the need for a physical key to unlock car doors. A “fob” or keychain, whether it’s in your hand, in a pocket, or in your bag, will unlock the door hands-free. The same fob works to start the engine.

* Keyless entry is intended to enable a driver to lock and unlock their car without a key. Keyless entry to a vehicle is usually attained by sending a radio frequency signal from a remote transmitter to the receiver in the car. According to Compustar, the signal is sent as encrypted data from the keychain to your car.

* Most keyless entry systems also allow the driver to open the vehicle, particularly the trunk, by pressing a button or using a shoe. The sensors for the trunk detect movement and open it automatically, a handy detail for those who are grocery shopping or moving. The car sends out the short radio signal. If the fob is in range, it’s then triggered to respond to the car, sending out its own code. The car recognizes this and unlocks the doors.

* The vast majority of these systems are one-way with limited range. The remote sends a signal to the car, but the car does not send a signal back. They also don’t work more than about 50 feet away.

### * Automatic Locking

Although, locking your car should come as second nature, very often, that niggling thought “have I locked the car?” does make you walk back just to be sure. Now, the keyless system saves you that trouble, because after the car is parked and you have walked a certain distance away, the car automatically locks itself. However, should you leave, forgetting the key fob in the car, the vehicle will stay unlocked. This of course ensures that you are not locked out of your car.
