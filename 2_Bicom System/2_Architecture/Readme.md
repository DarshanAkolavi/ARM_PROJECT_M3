 - Electronic Control Unit(ECU)         
    Electronic control unit that controls a series of actuators on an internal combustion engine to ensure optimal engine performance.
 - LCD Display  
   A liquid-crystal display (LCD) is a flat-panel display or other electronically modulated optical device.
   It uses the light-modulating properties of liquid crystals combined with polarizers. Liquid crystals do not emit light directly, instead using a backlight or reflector to      produce images in color or monochrome.
- LED  
   A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it. 
   Electrons in the semiconductor recombine with electron holes, releasing energy in the form of photons.
- Transmitter                 
   A radio transmitter is usually part of a radio communication system which uses electromagnetic waves (radio waves) to transport information (in this case sound) over a         distance.
- Buzzer                 
  The buzzer is a sounding device that can convert audio signals into sound signals. It is usually powered by DC voltage. It is widely used in alarms in Bicom System.
- Key Pad                                                
  Keypad access systems are simple security systems that require just a PIN code for door with no access card or credential required. Keypad systems are generally   used for     access applications with low security and a limited amount of users with authorized access.
- Power Supply           
  A power supply takes the AC from the wall outlet, converts it to unregulated DC, and reduces the voltage using an input power transformer, typically stepping it down to the     voltage required by the load.
