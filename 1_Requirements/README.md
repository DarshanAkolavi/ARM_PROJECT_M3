## SWOT Analysis

  1.Strengths
  
  2.Weakness
 * One drawback of the proposed protocol is, that the owner is responsible for updating the key fobs with new keys (randomnumbers).
 * When the board computer displays a request for updating the key fobs,
 * then the owner has to plug both key fobs into the interfaces located at the central console so that they can be programmed with the new keys.
 * How often new keys should be written to the key fobs, depends on how often the key fob(s) is/are used or at the latest after a certain time interval.

## Applications

* Remote keyless entry systems, now fairly commonplace devices, provide car owners with a degree of convenience, making the task of physically inserting a key unnecessarily.
* The introduced protocol has several advantages among common protocols used in Secure Remote Keyless Entry Systems. One advantage is the easy implementation of the introduced    protocol and of the lightweight encryption algorithm.
* In the proposed Remote Keyless Entry System, the driver has to press a button on the key fob to open or lock the car. This prevents the system from a Two-Thief Attack. Furthermore, with the proposed system it is almost impossible to become a victim of a Scan, Playback, or a Challenge Forward Prediction Attack since the authentication message consists of encrypted decimal numbers from randomly selected memory locations.
