## Applications

* Remote keyless entry systems, now fairly commonplace devices, provide car owners with a degree of convenience, making the task of physically inserting a key unnecessary. 
* A passive keyless entry (PKE) system uses advanced technology to take vehicle accessibility to a higher level. With PKE, car owners have simply to pull the door handle while the   key fob is on their person; no searching through pockets or purses, no button pressing necessary.
* Bi-directional communication makes this possible. When the door handle is pulled (or some similar trigger is activated) the base unit located within the vehicle emits a short     range, low frequency signal – polling for a nearby key fob transponder.
*  If present, the key fob recognizes the signal and responds with a UHF (ultra-high frequency) signal, transmitting a code to be authenticated by the base unit encryption          firmware, such as Microchip Technology’s Keylock.
*  Finally, if a proper code is verified, the base unit instructs the vehicle’s central body controller to unlock the door. Of course, all of this takes place within a fraction of    a second, without any additional action from the user.
